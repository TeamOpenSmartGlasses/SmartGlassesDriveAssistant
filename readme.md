# SmartGlassesDriveAssistant

This is an example app that displays your vehicle's speed and engine RPM on your smartglasses. It works in conjunction with the [SmartGlassesManager](https://github.com/TeamOpenSmartGlasses/SmartGlassesManager).

## Installation

* Install the [SmartGlassesManager](https://github.com/TeamOpenSmartGlasses/SmartGlassesManager) on your phone and make sure it's running.

* Install this app on your phone.

## Usage

This app gets your vehicle's speed and RPM from a Bluetooth ODB II reader. You can buy one for $13 [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09VXDBL8G?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details), but almost all other ELM327-based ODB II readers should work.

* Plug the OBD II reader into your vehicle

* Pair it with your phone in your Bluetooth settings

* Launch the app via the [SmartGlassesManager](https://github.com/TeamOpenSmartGlasses/SmartGlassesManager)
* * (Do this by saying: "Hey computer, drive assistant")
